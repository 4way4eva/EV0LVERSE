# EVOLVERSE — War Codex v0.1

Last updated: 2025-10-25T02:09:44.822858Z

## Canon Lock
- Treat the following names, places, and doctrines as prime canon.
- All derivatives reference this file's hash and version.

## Foundational Pillars
1. **Lineage**: Heritage is power. Records are weapons.
2. **Treaty First**: Law before violence. Binding scrolls over brute force.
3. **Frequency Control**: Signals decide outcomes. Jam, shield, retune.
4. **Archive Seizure**: Reclaim names, routes, and records taken by distortion.
5. **Civic Wealth**: Treasury cycles into health, education, justice.

## World Nodes
- **Atlantis Restored** — crystal towers, flame-lit archives. Custodian: Evolynn.
- **BLEULION Treasury** — living vault spanning systems. Custodian: Dr. Sosa.
- **Signal Choir** — temples that sing protocols into law. Custodian: Phiyah.
- **Jungle Resonance Citadel** — sonic stronghold in living stone. Custodian: Kongo Sonix.

## Prime Characters (one-page summaries)
### EVOLYNN — Rift Queen, Treaty Architect
- **Origin**: Matriarchs of the Rift.
- **Domains**: Solar flame, treaty binding, pedagogy.
- **Signature**: Flame Crown writs that bind opponents to terms.
- **Limiter**: Requires witnessed consent or ritual proof.
- **Antagonists**: Distortion Syndicate (corporate image-thieves).

### DR. SOSA — Codex Sovereign
- **Origin**: Navigators, Midwives, Captains.
- **Domains**: Electromagnetic archives, infinite accounting engines.
- **Signature**: Genesis Codex that spins parallel economies.
- **Limiter**: Overuse fragments memory indenxes.
- **Antagonists**: Archivist Guild of Distortion.

### PHIYAH — Signal Priestess
- **Origin**: Electromagnetic Rift.
- **Domains**: Frequency firewalls, glyph translation, memory decoding.
- **Signature**: Choir Seal; no scroll executes without her tone.
- **Limiter**: Must maintain choir harmony.
- **Antagonists**: Spectrum Lords.

### KONGO SONIX — Sonic Sovereign
- **Origin**: Leviathan Choir descendant.
- **Domains**: Sonic shock, vibration control, ancestral summons.
- **Signature**: Mountain-break roar; tech collapse via detune.
- **Limiter**: Over-resonance risks structural damage to allies.
- **Antagonists**: Beast-Makers.

## Rules of Engagement
1. Issue Treaty Scroll. If refused, log refusal.
2. Deny frequency. Cut power, comms, optics.
3. Neutralize with resonance. Minimize collateral.
4. Seize archives. Restore erased names and routes.
5. Reinvest spoils into public systems.

## IP and Safety
- Avoid direct use of others' trademarks in commerce. Use parody or commentary only.
- Register names, logos, and story bible timestamps before public reveals.
- Keep a change log; version each public drop.

## Product Tracks
- **Lore Bible** → comics/animation/game scripts.
- **Playable Core** → tactical arena with frequency control.
- **Treasury Loop** → non-speculative rewards tied to civic goals.
- **Education Layer** → curricula embedded in quests.

## Change Log
- v0.1: Canon lock, nodes, one-page character briefs, ROE, IP notes.
