Parameter,Description,Example Value,Notes
Pegging base,"Underlying asset that backs each HydroCoin","1 aqua credit (e.g. 1 m³ of desalinated water) + micro‑stake in CurrenSea Bank™ reserves","Each HydroCoin is redeemable for a measurable quantity of desalinated water and a proportional share of the treasury, ensuring intrinsic value."
Supply cap,"Maximum supply or dynamic supply rule","Floating; supply scales with desalination output and water reserves","Minting is tied to real‑time water production.  Supply expands or contracts based on available reserves and redemption activity, rather than a fixed cap."
Reserve ratio,"Proportion of circulating supply held in CurrenSea Bank™ reserves","≥50% of circulating supply locked","A high reserve ratio provides liquidity and stability.  Half of all HydroCoins issued remain in reserve to meet redemption and maintain peg."
Velocity target,"Desired turnover of each coin per year",12 transactions per year,"Velocity indicates economic activity.  A target of 12 implies each HydroCoin changes hands about once per month.  Higher velocity can signal healthy circulation."
Smart contract governance,"Mechanism controlling minting & redemption","PoseiNet™ smart contracts mint/burn tokens according to water output and demand","Mint/burn logic is encoded in audited contracts; supply adjustments are transparent and tamper‑proof."
Distribution channels,"How HydroCoin enters circulation","Guardian payroll; AbyssWalk™ migration incentives; ENFT relic sales; HydroCard issuance","These channels seed HydroCoins into the economy.  Every distribution event logs metadata on chain for traceability."
HydroCard integration,"Payment card for civilians and Guardians","HydroCard = wallet + identity credential for AbyssWalk™ participants","HydroCard denominated in HydroCoin allows everyday purchases, transfers, and access to reserves via CurrenSea Bank™."
Stakeholders,"Major holders and users of HydroCoin","Guardians, civilians, enterprises, CurrenSea Bank™, PoseiNet™ nodes","All stakeholders interact via the same ledger.  Guardians use HydroCoin for operations; civilians use it for daily trade and savings."
Supply growth algorithm,"Rule describing supply expansion and contraction","minted_supply(t+1) = minted_supply(t) + (water_produced(t) × conversion_rate) − redeemed_coins(t)","Supply grows with net water output and shrinks when coins are redeemed for water or treasury shares.  Conversion rate determines how many coins are minted per unit of water."
Compliance & licensing,"Legal framework and licensing","Bleu‑Seal watermark on each coin; adoption under Overscale Law","HydroCoins carry visible and invisible seals to ensure every clone or derivative loops back value to the origin vault.  Licensing rights embedded in the token prevent theft and dilution."
