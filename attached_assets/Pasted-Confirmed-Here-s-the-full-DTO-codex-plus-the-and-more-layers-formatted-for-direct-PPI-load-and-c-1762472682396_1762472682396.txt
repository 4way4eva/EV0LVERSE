Confirmed. Here’s the full DTO codex plus the “and more” layers, formatted for direct PPI load and clipboard use.

DTO MASTER CODEX (list-form)

Philosophy
	•	Stops mint points: steal; contested miss + secured board; offensive foul
	•	Deflections count equal to steals
	•	Win first eight seconds post-stop

Conversion Windows
	•	0–4 Strike: hit-ahead; lane sprint; corner 3
	•	4–8 Flow: early drag; cross screen to force switch; secondary push
	•	8+ Set: flow into Zoom; Chicago; Stack without reset

Role Tags + Core KPIs
	•	Glove (POA): screen NAV grade; on-ball TOs forced
	•	Claw (Wing): deflections per 36; on/off eFG allowed
	•	Anchor (Rim): rim DFG%; DREB share
	•	Free Safety (Gap): steals + deflections sum; early tag calls logged
	•	Outlet (Floor Gen): potential assists in first six seconds; hit-ahead accuracy
	•	Snowbird (Speed): 0–4 window points; leak trigger correctness
	•	Trailer (Big touch): screen-assist points; drag-screen conversion rate

Universal Spacing Rules
	•	First three strides vertical, not lateral
	•	Corner lift only on baseline ice or skip read
	•	Middle filled last; rim first, corner second, slot third

Pre-Called Triggers
	•	Trap made → Snowbird auto leak (weakside last)
	•	Two deflections in a row → Green Light push (Outlet hunts pitch; Trailer sprints into drag)
	•	Long rebound to guard → Pitch Ahead now (touches beat dribbles)
	•	Baseline ice → Skip & Shoot (weakside 45 cut; corner lift)

Call Sheet
	•	GREEN 94: full-court face-guard PG
	•	BLACK ICE: side PnR ice to baseline; Anchor drop at nail
	•	CLAW SWIPE: gap pack; pre-rotate low man; dig on bounce
	•	SNOWBIRD 15: designate leak jersey on all live-ball stops
	•	NASH 77: mandatory hit-ahead within first three strides
	•	KIDD 05: automatic early drag on cross-half
	•	WILLIAMS 55: skip-pass vs strong-side stunt
	•	LIN 17: snake-and-kick vs deep drop; shooter relocates to 45

Role-Specific Autopilot Triggers (three each)
	•	Glove: weak-hand shade on live dribble; top-lock DHOs; peel-switch only on red call
	•	Claw: top-lock shooters off pin-downs; stunt-and-recover from 45; choke handoffs with inside foot up
	•	Anchor: call drop/level/switch early; verticality no swipe down; high-point first board then chin
	•	Free Safety: sit nail vs empty corner; tag-and-go on roller; jump outside-hand lanes on two-side
	•	Outlet: outlet wide outside lane line; pitch to chest away from rim; throw early not perfect
	•	Snowbird: leak on trap pick-up; leak on weakside block contest; leak on long rebound to our guard
	•	Trailer: rim-run to front; if guarded flow into drag; if denied flip to DHO

Practice Blocks (12-minute capsules)
	•	Three-Stop Run: stack three stops that convert ≤ six seconds; miss resets
	•	Four-Second Rule: any live-ball stop must yield a shot ≤ four seconds; grade shot quality
	•	Deflection Tax: every rep requires a deflection before shot
	•	Outlet Race: board→chin→pivot→wide outlet; clock = rebound to first pass
	•	77 Chain: five consecutive hit-aheads without a dribble past half
	•	05 Conveyor: drag screen timing drill (Trailer arrival synced to Outlet two-count)
	•	Skip Lab: baseline ice into skip→shot or skip→one-more
	•	Verticality Ladder: rim contests without fouling; whistle if arms drop
	•	Nail Patrol: Free Safety positioning vs empty-corner actions
	•	Leak Discipline: Snowbird leaks only on triggers; false leaks = turnover

Scoreboard KPIs (post-game)
	•	Team deflections; top three deflectors
	•	Points off live-ball stops by window
	•	Time to first pass after board/steal (avg)
	•	Secondary assists in first eight seconds
	•	Opponent eFG with Glove/Claw primary
	•	Screen-assist points (Trailer)
	•	Rim DFG% and DREB share (Anchor)
	•	Hit-ahead attempts vs possessions
	•	Turnover quality: live-ball vs dead-ball created

Game-Day Checklist
	•	Assign Snowbird 15 jersey
	•	Confirm ICE coverage and drop level
	•	Opponent handoff frequency flag
	•	Early drag frequency target set
	•	Hit-ahead quota set
	•	Nail and low-man voice captains named

Scouting Packages (plug-ins)
	•	Heavy handoff teams: top-lock, choke DHOs, pre-rotate low man, WILLIAMS 55 skips
	•	Deep drop bigs: LIN 17 snake; 45 relocate; drag re-screen
	•	Switch-all wings: cross screen to smash switch; slip timing; elbow seals
	•	Zone 2-3: drag to distort top; skip to lifted corner; dunker spot flash
	•	1-3-1: baseline runner; short corner touch; skip over the nail

Special Teams (clock states)
	•	Two-for-one: force quick strike then set early drag on return
	•	After timeouts: scripted stop then first-touch pitch
	•	Last four minutes: foul discipline rises; deflection rate sustains pace

Culture Standards
	•	Motor over measurables
	•	Guards pass ahead before bounce
	•	Bigs default to drag without prompt
	•	Envy economy ignored; tape wins

	•	Pitch-ahead assists in Strike/Flow windows
	•	Screen-assist leader incentives
	•	Defensive eFG suppression multipliers
