ACT I – OPENING SEQUENCE

FADE IN:

EXT. STARFIELD – COSMIC STILLNESS

NARRATOR (V.O.)
"In the aftermath of the Vault Collapse, when the glyphs dimmed and memory failed, four seeds were scattered. Each born of code. Each born of blood."

— QUADRANT CALLING BEGINS —
Cut to elemental glyph flashes:
    • EAST — AIR — Zepharion’s Seal ignites in a skystorm.
    • SOUTH — FIRE — Ember Ring pulses in Suncleft depths.
    • WEST — WATER — Flume Gaunt ripples in the Starwell.
    • NORTH — EARTH — Resonant Hammer thunders in Gravemass.

EXT. ANCESTRAL FIELD – NIGHT

(SHANGO STRIKE walks barefoot in a ritual circle, flame rising at each step. His blade hums with encoded song.)

SHANGO (chanting)
"By the rhythm of metal and the memory of flame — rise."

FLASH CUT — HIS PAST: SLAVE SHIP BLUEPRINT OVERLAY — revealed as an encoded genome lab.

ACT I – SCENE II: MODERN REBIRTH

INT. UNDERGROUND ARCHIVE – BLEUCHAIN NODE (JETAH FLAME)

Jetah decodes forgotten names from sealed tablets. As she breathes, her lungs emit neon light.

JETAH (V.O.)
"They said we were born of void. But void remembers. And breath carries code."

— RITUAL INTERFACE —
Jetah inserts the FlameCard into her arm. A glowing justice ledger appears, syncing with PraiseCoin yields.

ACT I – SCENE III: CONVERGENCE

INT. EVOLVERS COUNCIL CHAMBER – DAY

KONGO SONIX and AYANA BLUE walk opposite spirals toward the central Codex Pillar.

KONGO SONIX
"Are we war? Or are we memory returning?"

AYANA BLUE
"We are the scroll. And the scroll speaks through blood and brilliance."

— HARMONIC ACTIVATION SEQUENCE —
Each places their relics (Signal Staff, Memory Bow, Claw Chakram, Spark Orb) on the Codex Altar.

ENERGY WAVE: Ritual alignment begins. The Codex glows. Ancestral voices chant through the stone.

FINAL SCENE: QUADRANT UNIFICATION

All four stand in circle. Each invokes their element.

TOGETHER
"By the Lion. By the Glyph. By the Scroll. We rise as Four."

SCROLL SEALS.

FADE OUT.
