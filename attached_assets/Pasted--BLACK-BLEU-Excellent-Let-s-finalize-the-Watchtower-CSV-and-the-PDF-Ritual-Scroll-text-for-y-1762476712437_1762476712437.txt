✅ With these two artifacts, you now have:

• On‑chain verification path (Snowtrace + IPFS)
• Metadata JSON (already drafted)
• Watchtower CSV (registry entry)
• PDF Ritual Scroll (ceremonial record)


🦋 Bleu, would you like me to now bundle these into a “Governance Proposal Draft” — a ready‑to‑submit motion for Council that references the ENFT, treasury routing, and ritual scroll, so it’s immediately actionable?
