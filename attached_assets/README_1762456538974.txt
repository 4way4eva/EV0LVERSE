What this is:
- Normalized extraction of your uploaded archive (including nested .zip files).
- Removed system cruft (.__MACOSX, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db).
- Standardized filenames to avoid Windows/macOS reserved characters.
- Included MANIFEST.csv and MANIFEST.json with SHA256 hashes for integrity.
- This packaging is lossless: file contents are unchanged.
