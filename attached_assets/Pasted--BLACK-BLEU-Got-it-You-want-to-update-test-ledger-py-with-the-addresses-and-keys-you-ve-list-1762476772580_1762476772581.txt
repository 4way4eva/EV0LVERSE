🟩 BLACK§BLEU 🔵 — Got it. You want to update test_ledger.py with the addresses and keys you’ve listed so that your ledger script reflects the correct wallets, validators, and signers. Here’s how you can structure that update:

✨ Suggested Update for `test_ledger.py`

# test_ledger.py — UltraMax Ledger Test Configuration

# Ethereum / Avalanche addresses
ADDR_MAIN   = "0x36CA5f34E5E873e7c3dF37432081d20b4Af320Be"
ADDR_TREAS  = "0x36CA5f34E5E873e7c3dF37432081d20b4Af320Be"
ADDR_RESERVE= "0x36CA5f34E5E873e7c3dF37432081d20b4Af320Be"

# Cosmos / CRO address
ADDR_CRO    = "cro1k6fjx9naayrjqxuqvcgw05h63vrz8lwgmz95lc"

# Validator / Signing keys (⚠️ never expose real private keys in code!)
SIGNER_1    = "H6kVe7oB56YLs8EYDhAtCRcPhXCsZdjnUFMkN9482DmP"
SIGNER_2    = "H6kVe7oB56YLs8EYDhAtCRcPhXCsZdjnUFMkN9482DmP"

# Ledger participants
LEDGER_PARTICIPANTS = {
    "main": ADDR_MAIN,
    "treasury": ADDR_TREAS,
    "reserve": ADDR_RESERVE,
    "cosmos": ADDR_CRO,
    "signer1": SIGNER_1,
    "signer2": SIGNER_2,
}

def verify_ledger():
    print("=== UltraMax Ledger Verification ===")
    for role, addr in LEDGER_PARTICIPANTS.items():
        print(f"{role.upper()} → {addr}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_ledger()

🔍 How to Verify

1. Local Test
Run:python3 test_ledger.py
You should see all addresses and signers printed in the correct roles.
2. On‑Chain Verification• For the 0x36CA... addresses → check them on Snowtrace.io (Avalanche C‑Chain). Paste the address into the search bar to see balances, transactions, and contract deployments.
• For the cro1k6f... address → check it on Cronos Explorer.
• For signers → these are not directly visible on explorers (they’re private keys or validator IDs). Instead, you’ll see their signatures in transaction logs.

3. Cross‑Check• Ensure that the addresses in your script match the ones you see on Snowtrace / Cronos Explorer.
• If you’ve deployed contracts, you should see them under the “Contracts” tab on Snowtrace.
• If you’ve minted NFTs or tokens, check the “Token Transfers” tab.

🦋 Bleu, this update makes your test_ledger.py a verification harness: it prints the addresses, and you can cross‑check them against Snowtrace and Cronos Explorer.

Do you want me to extend this script into a live verifier — one that actually queries Snowtrace and Cronos APIs to confirm balances, contract code, and recent transactions automatically?
