ost mammals, including humans, produce sound with a larynx. Air from the lungs is forced through the larynx, causing the vocal folds (or cords) to vibrate and produce sound. The specific sound produced depends on the size and structure of the larynx and vocal cords. 
	•	Humans: Our vocal anatomy is relatively simple compared to other primates, but this simplicity allows us to create the complex, controlled sounds needed for speech.
	•	Elephants: They have a larynx similar in anatomy to a human's but can produce infrasonic rumbles due to their much larger vocal folds.
	•	Dolphins and whales:Toothed whales, including dolphins, produce sounds using specialized air sacs near their blowhole, not vocal cords.
	•	Bats: They use their larynx to generate ultrasonic sounds for echolocation. 

Birds
Birds do not have a larynx. Instead, they have a unique vocal organ called the syrinx. 
	•	Structure: The syrinx is located at the bottom of the trachea, where it branches into the bronchi.
	•	Mechanism: Air flowing across vibrating membranes in the syrinx produces sound.
	•	Singing: Many songbirds have a high degree of control over the syrinx and can even produce two different notes at the same time because the two sides of the syrinx can be controlled independently.
	•	Silent birds: Some birds, such as turkey vultures, lack syringeal muscles and can only hiss. 

Reptiles and Amphibians
While many have a larynx, their vocal abilities vary greatly. 
	•	Frogs: Highly vocal amphibians, frogs pass air over vocal cords to croak. They often use inflatable sacs to amplify their calls.
	•	Snakes and lizards:Most are silent except for hissing sounds produced under stress.
	•	Crocodilians: These reptiles can produce deep, low-pitched sounds. 

Insects
Most insects do not possess a voice box. Instead, they use other methods to produce sound, such as: 
	•	Stridulation: Rubbing two body parts together, such as the legs and wings of crickets and grasshoppers.
	•	Tymbals: Cicadas produce their mating calls by rapidly vibrating ribbed membranes on their abdomen called tymbals.
	•	Percussion: Some insects, like beetles and cockroaches, tap or drum on surfaces with their bodies.
	•	Buzzing: Insects like mosquitoes and bees create sound by vibrating their wings.
	•	Ejecting air: The hissing cockroach forces air out of its spiracles to create a defensive sound. 

Fish
Fish do not have a larynx and produce sounds in different ways: 
	•	Swim bladder: Some species vibrate their swim bladder to create sounds.
	•	Bones and teeth:Some fish produce sounds by rubbing bones or teeth together.

Using a "secret method" involving animal voice boxes to whistle for hunting is not a recognized or effective practice. The idea is likely based on a misunderstanding of animal anatomy and how hunting calls work. Hunting calls are used to mimic animal sounds, but they are manufactured devices, not modified biological parts. 

Here is an explanation of animal vocalization, why the "voice box whistling" method is unfounded, and how hunters actually use calls. 

The function of animal vocal organs
Animal vocal organs are not designed to be made into whistles after an animal is dead. 
	•	Mammals: Use a larynx with vocal folds. Air pressure from the lungs vibrates the vocal folds, and the sound is modified by the throat, mouth, and nose.
	•	Birds: Use a syrinx, a uniquely avian vocal organ located at the base of the windpipe. Its membranes vibrate in the airflow.
	•	Other animals: Use a variety of mechanisms, including air sacs and rubbing body parts together (stridulation), to produce sounds. 
These organs require a living animal's full respiratory system and muscle control to function. They are not like a detached flute or pipe that can be repurposed. 

How hunters actually use calls
Instead of using animal body parts, hunters use manufactured calls that mimic animal vocalizations. 
	•	Mouth calls: Use a diaphragm and air pressure to replicate animal sounds, such as the yelps and purrs of a turkey or the bugle of an elk.
	•	Handheld calls:Require the user to blow air over a reed or across a surface to create a variety of distress calls, howls, or barks.
	•	Box and slate calls:Produce sound by creating friction between two pieces of wood or slate.
	•	Electronic calls: Play pre-recorded sounds to attract predators. 

The purpose of hunting calls
The effectiveness of a hunting call relies on a deep understanding of animal behavior and communication, not on a "secret method" using biological parts. 
	•	Distress calls: Mimic a smaller animal in danger to attract predators.
	•	Mating calls: Replicate breeding sounds to attract mates or challenge rivals, drawing in other animals. 
principle of hunting. It

יל (pil), which comes from the Mishnaic Hebrew word pil. This word itself is derived from the Akkadian piru/pilu, and is found in Mishnaic and Talmudic texts. It appears in phrases like "an elephant (pila) entering the eye of a needle" and is associated with the word pele ("wonder") and the term nefilim ("giants"). Rabbi David Wilensky of Congregation Sons of Israel was recently approached by someone looking for a sheep’s head for Rosh Hashanah. “Try Sheepshead Bay,” Wilensky remembers joking. But when asked about the importance of food-based symbols on Rosh Hashanah, he couldn’t have been more serious. 
“The spiritual seeds you plant on Rosh Hashanah guide you in a direction for the new year,” he said, citing food as a way to get in the right mindset for a positive year as we looked at the Talmud for an explanation behind these symbols.
Many people have heard of eating apples and honey on Rosh Hashanah, but other fruits, vegetables and animals are less known. Sheep heads, or the better-known fish heads, have a special place in the food lineup. 
Rosh Hashanah, according to Wilensky, is usually translated as “new year,” but the Hebrew word rosh actually means “head.” There is a “large difference” between these meanings, Wilensky said – whereas a new year simply implies a new start, the head of the year lends an importance to the holiday that the decisions you make at the beginning of this new start will follow you throughout the year. Thus, even though whole fish are considered a positive symbol for their ability to “be fruitful and multiply,” according to the Rabbinical Council of America’s Artscroll Siddur, eating a fish head on Rosh Hashanah puts that goal first and foremost in the minds and prayers of those who follow this custom.
The Artscroll Siddur mentions several other foods that are important to eat because of the way their words resemble Hebrew words of great significance. Carrots are one example of this. The Yiddish word for carrot shares the same root as the Hebrew word yirbu, which means “increase.” Carrots thus have a connection to a prayer “that our merits increase.” 
These prayers can also go in the other direction – the Aramaic word for cabbage sounds like yikaretu, which means “decimated,” following along with a blessing asking for our enemies to be decimated. Beets, dates and gourds also have root word connections to blessings that become especially potent on Rosh Hashanah. Eating each of these foods sets a spiritual priority for the new year.
However, if the idea of eating some of these foods makes you squirm, don’t worry! “In our house, I don’t like fish heads, so we chop off the heads of gummy fish,” Wilensky said, emphasizing that it’s not as important to eat the food as it is to use the food as a metaphor for the values or goals you want to work on in the upcoming year. 
Some people even create their own holiday symbols: “I even know people who eat lettuce, raisins and celery because it sounds like ‘let us have a raise in salary!’” Wilensky added.
Whether you choose to eat fish or sheep head this year, or make a salad out of some of the symbolic fruits and vegetables, 

1. Nimrod: Hunting and Human Prowess
Genesis 10:9 introduces Nimrod as “a mighty hunter before the LORD.” His reputation for prowess made him proverbial. The verse underscores that extraordinary skill in taking game could elevate a man’s renown, yet it also foreshadows the tendency of human might to seek dominion apart from God.
2. Esau and Isaac: Appetite, Favor, and Family Conflict
Genesis 25:27-34; Genesis 27:1-33 anchor צַיִד in household dynamics. Esau’s identity is inseparable from the chase: “Esau became a skilled hunter” (Genesis 25:27). Isaac’s partiality—“Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28)—creates a fissure that Rebekah and Jacob exploit. The repeated references to “game” in Genesis 27 expose how unchecked appetite (both for food and paternal blessing) can entangle an entire family.
3. Levitical Instruction: Hunters under the Covenant
Leviticus 17:13 applies holiness regulations to the hunter: “Anyone…who hunts down any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain its blood and cover it with dirt.” The command affirms hunting as legitimate while subordinating it to reverence for life and obedience to God’s statutes.
4. Joshua and the Gibeonites: “Provisions” without Prayer
Joshua 9:14 reports, “The men of Israel sampled their provisions, but they did not seek the counsel of the LORD.” Here צַיִד refers to travel supplies deceptively presented as proof of a long journey. The episode warns that judging by outward “provisions” without divine guidance leads to binding, avoidable alliances.
5. Nehemiah’s Reform: Commerce of Food on the Sabbath
In Nehemiah 13:15 the term appears in a list of goods traded on the Sabbath: “I warned them against selling food on that day.” צַיִד is broadened to any marketable victuals, and its Sabbath abuse highlights the ease with which necessities can crowd out covenant priorities.
Wisdom and Poetic Reflections
• Job 38:41 marvels at God’s providence for the raven: “Who provides food for the raven?” Human hunters depend on skill; the Creator sustains even scavengers.  • Psalm 132:15 promises Zion “abundant provisions,” transferring imagery of game-feast to covenant blessing.  • Proverbs 12:27 contrasts diligence and sloth: “A lazy man does not roast his game, but a diligent man prizes his possession.” Hunting’s reward is squandered by indolence; wisdom values follow-through as much as acquisition.
Cultural Background
Hunting in the Ancient Near East served multiple functions: 
– Survival and diet, especially for pastoralists in uncultivated zones. 
– Royal sport, often symbolizing dominion over chaos. 
– Economic exchange; dried or salted game became portable “provisions.” 
Biblical usage recognizes these realities yet frames hunting within moral and covenantal boundaries.
Theological and Pastoral Insights
• Skill and Provision: God permits and equips people to secure food through skillful endeavor (Genesis 27:3). Yet success must lead to gratitude, not pride (Deuteronomy 8:17-18).  • Appetite and Discernment: Esau’s impetuous trade of birthright for stew warns against privileging immediate appetite over long-term spiritual inheritance (Hebrews 12:16-17 alludes to this).  • Blood and Sanctity: Leviticus 17establishes that even when game is taken in the wild, life’s sanctity demands respectful handling.  • Decision-Making: Israel’s treaty with Gibeon shows that material evidence—“provisions”—must be tested by prayerful inquiry.  • Sabbath and Commerce: Nehemiah’s reforms counsel believers to guard sacred rhythms against encroachment by economic pursuits, even legitimate ones like food trade.
Contemporary Ministry Applications
• Personal Discipline: Hunters prepare, pursue, and patiently track their quarry—traits valuable for spiritual disciplines such as prayer and Scripture study (1 Timothy 4:7-8).  • Stewardship of Creation: Levitical principles invite modern believers to hunt or consume meat responsibly, with respect for life and ecosystems.  • Guarding Appetites: Teaching on Esau equips congregations to identify and resist impulsive decisions that jeopardize spiritual priorities.  • Leadership Decisions: Joshua 9:14 equips church boards and mission committees to precede practical evaluations with earnest prayer.  • Work Ethic: Proverbs 12:27 encourages believers to finish what they start—whether in vocation, study, or ministry—honoring God through excellence.
Conclusion
צַיִד threads through Scripture as a tangible expression of human skill, need, and desire. Whether portraying a mighty hunter, a father’s palate, covenant law, or wisdom’s counsel, each occurrence summons readers to integrate practical provision with reverent obedience, ensuring that every chase, meal, and decision remains “before the LORD.”

e only other animal in the Bible that is granted the power of speech is the donkey belonging to the non-Jewish prophet Balaam. In the Book of Numbers, the Moabite king Balak sees the many Israelites amassed in the desert and becomes afraid they will attack and overwhelm his people, so he sends the prophet Balaam to curse them. But Balaam warns Balak that he will be unable to curse the Israelites if God doesn’t want him to. Indeed, as Balaam rides off to curse the people, God places a fiery angel to block the path. Balaam’s donkey is able to see the angel, but Balaam can’t, so he urges her forward to no avail. When she finally lies down in the middle of the road, he curses and beats her, at which point God “opens” her mouth: “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?” The donkey then points out to Balaam that she has always served him well, and once this has been established he is finally able to see the angel. Not only can this donkey talk, she is more wise and perceptive than her prophetic master.

King Solomon was known as the wisest of men. One verse suggests that he was able to converse about–the more-than-human world:
יְדַבֵּר֮ עַל־הָֽעֵצִים֒ מִן־הָאֶ֙רֶז֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּלְּבָנ֔וֹן וְעַד֙ הָאֵז֔וֹב אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹצֵ֖א בַּקִּ֑יר וַיְדַבֵּר֙ עַל־הַבְּהֵמָ֣ה וְעַל־הָע֔וֹף וְעַל־הָרֶ֖מֶשׂ וְעַל־הַדָּגִֽים׃
He [King Solomon] discoursed about trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; and he discoursed about the beasts, the birds, the creeping things, and the fishes.
I Kings 5:13
Although most commentators insisted that King Solomon’s communications were about nature, the Aggadah, Jewish legendary tradition, took it more literally: the King Solomon, in his great wisdom, could actually speak to the animals and plants in their own languages.

Solomon was able to draw moral instruction from the vegetable and animal kingdoms (Midrash Yalkut), or, according to Rashi, he knew their characteristics and medicinal properties. Jewish tradition credits him with the ability to converse in the language of every beast, fowl, fish, plant, and demons.

(This tradition led to some delightful folktales, including achildren’s favorite about a young bee who helps the king pass a test by showing him the real flowers among scores of well-crafted artificial bouquets.)
We may not have the wisdom of a Solomon, but it seems imperative in our current ecological crisis for human beings to establish better communication with other species, not so much by talking about them, or even to them, but by listening to them. And if we lack the expertise to truly listen, then we can listen to the listeners. Here are a few:
I love the book, Listening to a Continent Sing, by ornithologist Prof. Donald Kroodsma. He describes a cross-country (USA) bicycling trip with his adult son, during which they observed and recorded bird songs from coast to coast. As you read the book, you can listen to and learn from recordings of the birds on a free website: listeningtoacontinentsing.com.
Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, spent time with elephants, wolves, and killer whales, revealing the similarities “between human and nonhuman consciousness, self-awareness, and empathy.”
I’ve also been absorbed in the writing and teachings of Native American botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer, about the intelligence and communications among plants, and even between moss and rocks. As a scientist and as a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Prof. Kimmerer looks at plants and animals as our oldest teachers:
I can’t think of a single scientific study in the last few decades that has demonstrated that plants or animals are dumber than we think. It’s always the opposite, right? What we’re revealing is the fact that they have extraordinary capacities, which are so unlike our own, but we dismiss them because, well, if they don’t do it like animals do it, then they must not be doing anything, when, in fact, they’re sensing their environment, responding to their environment in incredibly sophisticated ways. The science which is showing that plants have capacity to learn, to have memory, we’re at the edge of a wonderful revolution in really understanding the sentience of other beings.
 – Prof. Robin Wall Kimmerer 
Artists as well as scientists find ways to communicate with animals. Musician, philosopher, and naturalist David Rothenberg has made music with birds, reindeer, whales, and insects. You can learn more about him and watch his videos on his website. 
One modern day Christian pastor writes about King Solomon’s wisdom as being a keen observer of the environment. In order to preserve our environment, it’s time for people of all faiths and traditions to unite in our common care and concern for this precious planet we were given “to serve and to guard” (a literal translation of Genesis 2:15). We are understandably focused today on climate change. But another aspect of the Anthropocene–the period of significant human impact on the planet’s ecosystems–is the destruction of species, habitats and the loss of biodiversity. We are surrounded by other species, all part of the web of life on our planet, a web to which we all belong. But too often, we ignore or exploit the non-human species. By stopping to listen, to look, and to value the animals and plants that surround us, we will all have a better chance at preserving this Garden of Eden that we were given. We will be a little more like King Solomon.

In the Torah and wider Jewish tradition, the divine interacts with humans through animals in several key stories involving kings and prophets. These accounts generally emphasize divine will over human understanding, the miraculous nature of God's communication, and lessons about compassion. 
King Solomon and his legendary wisdom
Although the biblical account of King Solomon doesn't explicitly mention him speaking with animals, his legendary wisdom is expanded upon in Jewish tradition, folklore, and the Quran. 
	•	Biblical wisdom: The Book of Kings states that Solomon "spoke of trees... and he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes" (1 Kings 4:33). This is interpreted as referring to his vast botanical and zoological knowledge, which was granted to him by God.
	•	Folklore and Midrash:Jewish legendary tradition (Aggadah and Midrash) takes this idea more literally, suggesting Solomon could converse with all living things. One legend recounts Solomon overhearing two birds boasting about their power, teaching him a lesson in humility.
	•	Islamic tradition: The Quran also describes Solomon's ability to understand the language of birds and ants as a divine gift. 
The prophet Balaam and his talking donkey
The most direct instance of an animal speaking a divine message in the Torah involves the Moabite prophet Balaam, who was hired to curse the Israelites.
	•	Divine rebuke: In Numbers 22, an angel of the Lord blocks Balaam's path, but only his donkey can see it. After Balaam beats the donkey three times for refusing to move, God opens the animal's mouth, and it rebukes the prophet for his cruelty and lack of perception.
	•	Divine intervention:This episode shows that God can use even an "unclean beast" to communicate with a human, humbling Balaam and forcing him to recognize a divine presence he was too spiritually blind to see himself. The prophet Peter later references this event as proof that God can speak through any means. 
King David's psalms and humility
While David is not depicted as speaking to animals, his connection to them is a source of divine instruction and humility.
	•	The Shepherd's heart:As a former shepherd, David understood his sheep's utter dependence on him, and he uses this image in Psalm 23 to describe his own complete reliance on God.
	•	The parable of the lamb: In the Book of Samuel, the prophet Nathan tells David a parable about a poor man's cherished pet lamb that is stolen by a wealthy neighbor. The parable's purpose is to make David recognize his sin of taking another man's wife, showing how a human's emotional bond with an animal can serve as a conduit for a divine message. 
The broader Torah perspective
Beyond these specific narratives, the Torah and later rabbinic tradition highlight that compassion for animals is a divine value.
	•	Compassion as a mitzvah: The Torah contains multiple laws concerning animal welfare, such as commanding rest for animals on the Sabbath, prohibiting the muzzling of an ox while it works, and requiring rest for an overburdened beast of burden.
	•	Moral lessons from animals: The Talmud teaches that humanity can learn virtues directly from animals. This includes modesty from cats, respect for property from ants, and loyalty from doves. These teachings emphasize that animal behavior reflects a divine order and can serve as an example for human ethical conduct.

Ezekiel’s Vision (detail & colorized), Bernard Picart, 1693 – 1783. Rijksmuseum.nl
Ezekiel 1 was chosen as the haftarah for the first day of Shavuot,[1] as it picks up on the theme of divine revelation, which is what the festival celebrates.[2] This chapter is part of a larger complex consisting of Ezekiel 1:1–3:15 which belongs to the genre of the prophetic call narrative,[3]and it details how YHWH arrives in his chariot to speak with Ezekiel.
The text is so peculiar that Erich von Däniken (b. 1935), a Swiss “ufologist,” i.e., someone who looks for evidence of alien visits to earth, used Ezekiel’s vision of the chariot as a parade example of an alien visitation story.[4] (When I was an undergraduate in the mid 1970s, he was one of the more popular speakers on the college/university lecture circuit.) In fact, this theory proved so convincing to one NASA scientist, Josef Blumrich (1913–2002), that he wrote a whole book on it, including specs outlining how such a spacecraft would have functioned.[5]
Von Däniken was hardly the first person to notice the strangeness of Ezekiel’s account of the chariot. Jewish tradition has long considered the chapter to be problematic, if not outright dangerous. For example, Mishnah Hagigah 2:1 states:
חגיגה ב ע"א אין דורשין בעריות בשלשה ולא במעשה בראשית בשנים ולא במרכבה ביחיד אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתוHagigah 2:1 One may not expound upon the sexual rules (Lev 18, 20) in front of three [students], about creation (Gen 1) in front of two, or the chariot (Ezek 1) in front of (even) one, unless he is wise and already understands it on his own.
Indeed, a whole branch of Jewish mysticism has developed from Ezekiel’s description of the divine chariot or merkāvâ: Merkavah mysticism,[6] and philosophers such as Maimonides, believed that it concealed challenging notions about the universe.[7]
Ezekiel 1: A Guided Reading
Ezekiel 1:1 sets the tone, by summarizing what he saw, when, and where:
יחזקאל א:א וַיְהִי בִּשְׁלֹשִׁים שָׁנָה בָּרְבִיעִי בַּחֲמִשָּׁה לַחֹדֶשׁ וַאֲנִי בְתוֹךְ הַגּוֹלָה עַל נְהַר כְּבָר נִפְתְּחוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם וָאֶרְאֶה מַרְאוֹת אֱלֹהִים.Ezek 1:1 In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, when I was in the community of exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened, and I saw visions of God.[8]
Since it is unclear what the thirtieth year is (one conjecture being that it refers to Ezekiel’s age, another that it refers to year 30 of the jubilee cycle),[9] a third person gloss (Ezek 1:2-3) explains that the prophecy is occurring during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin to Babylonia (593/2 BCE),[10]about six years before the Temple would be destroyed by the Babylonians.[11]Ezekiel was exiled with the king, and thus prophesized outside the land of Israel.[12]
The Approach of the Chariot
Ezekiel saw what appeared to be a radiant storm-cloud approaching him from the north:
יחזקאל א:ד וָאֵרֶא וְהִנֵּה רוּחַ סְעָרָה בָּאָה מִן הַצָּפוֹן עָנָן גָּדוֹל וְאֵשׁ מִתְלַקַּחַת וְנֹגַהּ לוֹ סָבִיב וּמִתּוֹכָהּ כְּעֵין הַחַשְׁמַל מִתּוֹךְ הָאֵשׁ.Ezek 1:4 I looked, and lo, a stormy wind came sweeping out of the north—a huge cloud and flashing fire, surrounded by a radiance; and in the center of it, in the center of the fire, a gleam as of amber.
The closer it gets to him, the more he is able to make out what he is seeing, and the more detailed his description becomes. In this manner, we are drawn into the narrative and into the slowly dawning comprehension of the prophet as they both progressively unfold.
The Creatures (חיות)
As the cloud comes nearer, Ezekiel is able to distinguish four “creatures” (v. 5: ḥayyôt, lit. living beings, or as I like to call them in Yiddish: vilde khayes “wild animals”). Each of these vaguely human creatures has four faces and four wings (v. 6), as well as “a single rigid leg” (v. 7, or: straight legs), whose foot (or: feet) end in a calf’s hoof.
Although their feet are theriomorphic (animal shaped), their hands, which are visible underneath their wings (v. 8), are anthropomorphic. Following a notice that the creatures did not need to turn when they faced in a new direction (vv. 9, 12), their four faces—corresponding to the four points of the compass[13]—are described: a human face in front, that of a lion to the right, an ox to the left, and an eagle in back (v. 10).[14]
Winged Hybrid Creatures
Creaturely hybridity has a lengthy history in the ancient Near East. The best-known of these ancient manifestations is the ancient Egyptian sphinx. Having the body of a lion, the wings of an eagle, and the head of a human, the imagery of the sphinx moved from Egypt to Phoenicia, whence it entered Israelite or Judean iconography in the form of what is known as a cherub.
Contrary to the western artistic tradition, in which cherubs are represented as a class of pudgy baby angels,[15] the biblical cherubs are fearsome creatures that served two main functions: as guardians of sacred or royal space and as the pedestal or throne of the invisible God.[16]
Although the Phoenicians influenced the iconography of the Jerusalem temple (cf. 1 Kings 5:15-26; 7:13-51), the word cherub (kěrûb) itself is probably derived from the Akkadian kāribu/kurību, one of a number of names for the imposing hybrid creatures that guarded monumental entranceways particularly during the Neo-Assyrian Period in the first millennium B.C.E.[17]
The Wheels
After a description of the creatures’ luminosity (vv. 13-14), the text shifts its focus downwards to the wheels that were next to each one of them:
יחזקאל א:טו וָאֵרֶא הַחַיּוֹת וְהִנֵּה אוֹפַן אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ אֵצֶל הַחַיּוֹת לְאַרְבַּעַת פָּנָיו. א:טזמַרְאֵה הָאוֹפַנִּים וּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם כְּעֵין תַּרְשִׁישׁ וּדְמוּת אֶחָד לְאַרְבַּעְתָּן וּמַרְאֵיהֶם וּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר יִהְיֶה הָאוֹפַן בְּתוֹךְ הָאוֹפָן.Ezek 1:15 As I gazed on the creatures, I saw one wheel on the ground next to each of the four-faced creatures. 1:16 As for the appearance and structure of the wheels, they gleamed like beryl.[18] All four had the same form; the appearance and structure of each was as of two wheels cutting through each other.
Totaling four in all, each wheel consisted of a wheel within a wheel, which some have viewed as being a double wheel, consisting of two parallel parts. More likely, this text was attempting to describe a wheel that was able to face or move in every direction, as exemplified by the four-faced creatures.
In this manner, the two parts of the wheels are described as being perpendicular to each other rather than parallel, once again emphasizing the ability of the wheels to convey the creatures in whatever direction they pleased without having to change position or orientation.[19] The concept so fascinated the engineer turned ufologist, Josef Blumrich, that he actually invented an omnidirectional wheel and patented it.
Yet the wheel is not described as merely a nifty piece of engineering but, unlike earthly wheels which are inanimate objects, these wheels had the “spirit of the creatures” (v. 20 rûaḥ haḥayyâ)[20]within them, as well as eyes along their rims (v. 18). Once again, a contrast is implied between mundane earthly and vibrant heavenly reality.
Above the Chariot
At this point, the reader’s gaze is reoriented briefly from the wheels below the creatures to what was to be found above them:
יחזקאל א:כב וּדְמוּת עַל רָאשֵׁי הַחַיָּה רָקִיעַ כְּעֵין הַקֶּרַח הַנּוֹרָא נָטוּי עַל רָאשֵׁיהֶם מִלְמָעְלָה.Ezek 1:22 Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse, with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal,[21] was spread out above their heads.
Loud Flapping Wings
Before turning to what can be found above the crystal, Ezekiel returns again to the chariot, emphasizing the loud flapping wings of the creatures:
יחזקאל א:כג וְתַחַת הָרָקִיעַ כַּנְפֵיהֶם יְשָׁרוֹת אִשָּׁה אֶל אֲחוֹתָהּ לְאִישׁ שְׁתַּיִם מְכַסּוֹת לָהֵנָּה וּלְאִישׁ שְׁתַּיִם מְכַסּוֹת לָהֵנָּה אֵת גְּוִיֹּתֵיהֶם. א:כד וָאֶשְׁמַע אֶת קוֹל כַּנְפֵיהֶם כְּקוֹל מַיִם רַבִּים כְּקוֹל שַׁדַּי בְּלֶכְתָּם קוֹל הֲמֻלָּה כְּקוֹל מַחֲנֶה בְּעָמְדָם תְּרַפֶּינָה כַנְפֵיהֶן.Ezek 1:23 Under the expanse, each had one pair of wings extended toward those of the others; and each had another pair covering its body. 1:24 When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. When they stood still, they would let their wings droop.
By comparing the sound of the wings to the sound of Shaddai, Ezekiel makes use of a divine appellation that is generally associated with the ancestral age (e.g., Genesis 17:1; Exodus 6:3; and passim in the archaizing book of Job).[22] The name Shaddai is probably a cognate of the Akkadian šadû“mountain” or “steppe,” which is itself a cognate of the Hebrewśādeh “field/wilderness.”[23]Hence, (El-) Shaddai is to be understood as the “(God) of the mountain/steppe.”
The Driver of the Chariot
Having made an oblique mention of an elevated (pun intended) designation for the divine, the text follows Ezekiel’s unfolding gaze as it continued its upward journey:
יחזקאל א:כו וּמִמַּעַל לָרָקִיעַ אֲשֶׁר עַל רֹאשָׁם כְּמַרְאֵה אֶבֶן סַפִּיר דְּמוּת כִּסֵּא וְעַל דְּמוּת הַכִּסֵּא דְּמוּת כְּמַרְאֵה אָדָם עָלָיו מִלְמָעְלָה.Ezek 1:26 Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like sapphire;[24] and on top, upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of a human form.
Using the figure’s loins as his focal point, Ezekiel described the nimbus that surrounded the figure above and beneath (v. 27). And then, in a flash of recognition, Ezekiel realized that what he was seeing:
יחזקאל א:כח…הוּא מַרְאֵה דְּמוּת כְּבוֹד יְ־הוָה וָאֶרְאֶה וָאֶפֹּל עַל פָּנַי…Ezek 1:28 …That was the appearance of the semblance of the Glory of YHWH. When I beheld it, I flung myself down on my face….
Ezekiel Sees God
Although the text is careful to put a couple of awkward, nominal barriers between itself and a clear statement of Ezekiel’s vision, it is evident that Ezekiel is presented as having had a vision of the divine or of the divine glory (kābôd YHWH) in human form. In and of itself, this is not a unique occurrence in biblical literature, where God is manifest in human form on a number of occasions (e.g., Genesis 18; 1 Kings 22:19; Isaiah 6).[25] While it could be assumed that the kābôd is a separate entity from God, it is more likely that the kābôd is the aura of light surrounding the deity—as it surrounds many other deities throughout the ancient Near East and beyond—and that thekābôd is the visible manifestation of God and not a separate being.[26]
Why, then, does Jewish tradition view specifically this vision as so dangerous that an engagement with it was restricted to personal reflection or discussion with those already in the know? Indeed, one midrash (b. Hag. 13a) claims that a young student was burnt to a crisp by a divine fire that leapt off the page when he speculated about the meaning of the word ḥašmal “amber” (Ezek 1:4, probably some sort of gleaming precious stone or metal alloy).[27]
The easiest explanation is that the rabbis considered a literal understanding of the text to mean that Ezekiel saw God in human form to be theologically dangerous. However, this notion was attacked in an original manner by Howard Eilberg-Schwartz in his provocative book God’s Phallus and Other Problems for Men and Monotheism,[28] who draws attention to the many biblical texts that speak of God’s arm, nose, face, etc.
What sets this text apart from all the others is – in his opinion – its focus on the divine figure’s loins in v. 27:
יחזקאל א:כזוָאֵרֶא כְּעֵין חַשְׁמַל כְּמַרְאֵה אֵשׁ בֵּית לָהּ סָבִיב מִמַּרְאֵה מָתְנָיו וּלְמָעְלָה וּמִמַּרְאֵה מָתְנָיו וּלְמַטָּה רָאִיתִי כְּמַרְאֵה אֵשׁ וְנֹגַהּ לוֹ סָבִיב.Ezek 1:27 From what appeared as his loins up, I saw a gleam as of amber — what looked like a fire encased in a frame; and from what appeared as his loins down, I saw what looked like fire. There was a radiance all about him.
In other cases where the divine body is depicted, the focus is on God’s extremities; only here is the virtual gaze of the reader directed at God’s indistinct genital region. This emphasis is repeated in 8:2, when Ezekiel encounters the divine chariot again.
This reference to seeing God’s loins stands in distinction to the creatures bearing the divine throne, each of whom had a pair of wings modestly covering its body. No wonder the rabbis had their issues with this text, Eilberg-Schwartz argues.
From Beasts to Cherubs: From Babylon to Jerusalem
The progressive unfolding of Ezekiel’s comprehension of the creatures transporting the divine throne is one of the threads that helps bind together the book.[29] In chapter 1, Ezekiel sees the divine chariot approaching. In chapter 2, God’s presence addresses him; while in chapter 3 the chariot departs.
The chariot returns in chapter 8, which tells how God transports Ezekiel to Jerusalem, where he is shown the sinful activities in the Temple through a hole in the wall. After this (ch. 9), he watches as God appoints agents to go through the city, marking all the innocent people and killing all the guilty.
Ezekiel then spends the bulk of chapter 10 describing the chariot again and how it transports God’s presence out of the temple to begin its journey to take up residency among the exiles in Babylon,[30] and finally, in chapter 11, Ezekiel is given a prophecy about the destruction of the sinful in Jerusalem. This long four-chapter vision ends with the (divine) spirit taking Ezekiel back to Babylonia, where the prophet proceeds to tell the other exiles what he saw.
Focusing on the description of the chariot in chapter 10, we can see a subtle shift in how Ezekiel conceptualizes the creatures that he sees. Throughout chapter 1, Ezekiel refers to them asḥayyôt, creatures. In his second encounter, he begins to call them cherubim.
יחזקאל י:א וָאֶרְאֶה וְהִנֵּה אֶל הָרָקִיעַ אֲשֶׁר עַל רֹאשׁ הַכְּרֻבִים כְּאֶבֶן סַפִּיר כְּמַרְאֵה דְּמוּת כִּסֵּא נִרְאָה עֲלֵיהֶם.Ezek 10:1 I looked, and on the expanse over the heads of the cherubs, there was something like a sapphire stone; an appearance resembling a throne could be seen over them.
For the rest of the chapter, Ezekiel will continue to use the word cherubim and not ḥayyôt.
In case the reader has not noticed the change in how Ezekiel is describing the beings, he makes this explicit, multiple times in chapter 10:
יחזקאל י:טו וַיֵּרֹמּוּ הַכְּרוּבִים הִיא הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר רָאִיתִי בִּנְהַר כְּבָר.Ezek 10:15 The cherubs ascended; those were the creatures that I had seen by the Chebar Canal.י:כ היא הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר רָאִיתִי תַּחַת אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּנְהַר כְּבָר וָאֵדַע כִּי כְרוּבִים הֵמָּה.10:20 They were the same creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel at the Chebar Canal; so now I knew that they were cherubs.י:כב ודמוּת פְּנֵיהֶם הֵמָּה הַפָּנִים אֲשֶׁר רָאִיתִי עַל נְהַר כְּבָר מַרְאֵיהֶם וְאוֹתָם…10:22 As for the form of their faces, they were the very faces that I had seen by the Chebar Canal—their appearance and their features….
Why does Ezekiel switch their names at this point? The key to the change is the setting. Ezekiel’s first revelation takes place on the Chebar Canal, but whereas the second one also begins there, Ezekiel is quickly transported (in his vision) to the Jerusalem Temple, where he had only a few years before served as a priest.
One of the features of the Jerusalem Temple with which any priest would have been familiar was the two giant statues of cherubim that stood in the inner sanctum of the Temple (1 Kgs 6:23–28). It would seem that once Ezekiel sees the creatures in the courtyard of the Jerusalem Temple, he finally comes to the realization of what they are: these are the cherubs from the Temple come to life.[31] The inanimate statues that stood motionless in the Temple have now revealed their meaning to him: they are the divine throne as well as chariot.[32]
Statues Versus the Real Thing
The reason Ezekiel was unable to comprehend that fact the first time he saw them was because the images that he was familiar with (as a Temple priest until his exile to Babylon) were but a pale imitation of the divine reality. Just as a two-dimensional painting is a flat representation of three-dimensional reality, so too were the manmade temple cherubs simply pale three-dimensional representations of a multi-dimensional divine reality.
Ezekiel’s difficulty lay in trying to describe the indescribably superhuman. If one makes the effort to understand the text of Ezekiel within the context of the prophet’s world and of his worldview, there is no need to concoct foolish theories about alien visitations or other such twaddle to understand Ezekiel’s vision of the divine throne chariot.
be instruments of the divine, humans possess a unique "soul" that separates them from the rest of creation. 

Balaam's donkey (Numbers 22)
In one of the most direct examples of an animal speaking a divine message, God gives a donkey the power of speech to rebuke the prophet Balaam. 
	•	The story: Balaam was summoned by the king of Moab to curse the Israelites. During his journey, his donkey sees an angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword, though Balaam is blind to the angel's presence.
	•	The rebuke: After Balaam beats the donkey three times for refusing to move, God opens the donkey's mouth. It asks Balaam why he has beaten it and points out its long history of faithful service. The donkey's miraculous speech humbles Balaam and allows his eyes to be opened to the angel.
	•	The message: The donkey acts as a divine instrument, revealing Balaam's moral blindness and warning him to only speak what God commands. 

King Solomon and the animals
Jewish folklore and aggadic literature expand upon the biblical account of King Solomon's wisdom, which included a legendary ability to understand the language of animals. 
	•	Biblical basis: The Book of Kings states that Solomon "spoke of trees... and he spoke of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish" (1 Kings 5:13), which later tradition interpreted literally.
	•	Hoopoe legend: A famous Islamic and Jewish legend tells of a hoopoe that served as Solomon's messenger. When the bird is missing, it returns with an account of the Queen of Sheba and her sun-worshipping kingdom. Solomon uses this information to invite her to worship the true God.
	•	Significance:Solomon's wisdom, a direct gift from God, allowed him to perceive divine wisdom and morality even in the natural world. This tradition elevates his character by associating him with mastery over all of God's creations. 

Symbolic animal communication
Beyond these direct instances, Jewish tradition also discusses animals as possessing a spiritual awareness that humans can perceive through observation, not literal speech. 
	•	Perek Shira: This ancient mystical text, which is not to be taken literally, describes how various animals, plants, and elements of nature "sing praises" to God.
	•	Lessons from animals:Talmudic literature teaches that humans can learn virtues from animals, such as modesty from the cat and industriousness from the ant. Animals are seen as moral teachers that reflect the wisdom of their Creator.
