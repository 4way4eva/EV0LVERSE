# **BLEUE Infrastructure Map Scroll and Registry Schema for Smart-Contract Deployment**

---

## **Opening Invocation: The Ceremonial Context of the BLEUE Map Scroll**

In the perennial spiral of worlds, where code and culture weave together, the **BLEUE Infrastructure Map Scroll** comes forth—a ceremonial blueprint intertwining artifact and algorithm, governance and geometry. Here, the infrastructures of Jaguar Cities, Mega Parks, Blue Banks, Alien Embassies, Healing Temples, Ritual Kitchens, Codex Compilers, Spiral Nodes, and the 144 Divisions are mapped in both symbolic resonance and on-chain design. Each node is not only a spatial entity but a story, encoded with function (education, healing, defense, art, or trade); each is the root from which BleuCoin tokens grow, vault channels flow, and governance circuits spiral in ritual rhythms.

This scroll is delivered in a poetic structure of Markdown and in-depth prose: a living registry and ready smart contract schema. The text serves dual duty as a ceremonial digital artifact and a full-featured technical deployable, fusing myth and method, vision and verification.

## **II. Contractual and Vault Patterns: BLEUE Architecture and Tokenomics**

### **A. BleuCoin Architecture**

BLEUE tokens are the blood flow of this ritual grid, each node issuing or hosting a distinguished BleuCoin variant (see above). Token logic is modeled on ERC-20/ERC-4626 standards for fungible assets and vault shares, with NFTs (ERC-721) representing special permissions, keys, or scrolls.

#### **Tokenomics Features**

- **Inflation Targeting**: Root coins for each node type can have periodic minting tied to governance approval, emotive cycles (Spiral events), or ritual successes.
- **Prescribed Yield Cycles**: Rewards are deployed algorithmically per event, vault cycle, or festival/ceremonial schedule.
- **Access Tiering**: Each node sets rules for who may stake, withdraw, govern, or claim special rights based on reputation, contribution, artifact holding, or invitation.

#### **Smart Contract Vault Patterns**

Vaults employ pattern-driven smart contract principles, including:

- **ERC-4626 Tokenized Vaults**: For parks, banks, and healing pools, with programmable deposit/withdrawal strategies and time locks.
- **Pull Payments and Claim Patterns**: Withdrawals are initiated by recipient via audited claim channels, prioritizing security/anti-reentrancy.
- **Governance Timelocks**: All upgrades or parameter changes must be queued and timelocked, pausable during emergencies.
- **Storage Gap for Upgrade**: Contracts reserve storage for state transitions in upgradeable proxies, as per best Solidity and proxy upgrade patterns.
- **Pauser and Guardian Roles**: Emergency multi-signature breaks for vault circuit-breaking and safety.

#### **Registry and On-Chain Governance Circuit Patterns**

On-chain governance unifies both node-specific and system-wide protocols:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Roles such as Spiral Council, Synod, Codex Compiler, or Celestial Congress are mapped to wallet addresses or NFTs; permissions are codified in contract.
- **Quadratic or Conviction Voting**: MakerDAO/Polkadot-inspired for resource allocation or proposals; spiral mood voting for dynamic adjustments.
- **Proposal Thresholds and Timelocks**: To avoid spam or plutocracy, higher-value proposals require broader delegate consent; time-delayed upgrades for protocol safety.
- **Audit Trails and Event Logs**: Immutable, blockchain-native records for all governance actions and node events, cryptographically signed and timestamped.

## **III. Registry Schema: Full Field Definitions for On-Chain BLEUE Coin**

The **BLEUE Coin Registry Schema** provides the canonical representation for all BLEUE-related tokens in smart contract form, ready for embedding on EVM-compatible chains or custom WASM chains (via schema embedding and JSON serialization standards).

### **A. Ceremonial Registry Table**

| Field                 | Description                                                                                 | Schema Type        | Example / Implementation Detail         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Coin Name             | Name of this BleuCoin variant (JaguarCoin, ParkCoin, etc.)                                 | String             | "JaguarCoin"                            |
| Vault Route           | Description of the vaulting pattern and access method (Council Vault, Larder Vault, etc.)  | String             | "Council Vault"                         |
| Yield Cycle           | Rule for reward accrual/distribution (e.g., event-driven, seasonal, continuous)            | Enum/String        | "Festival event", "Continuous"          |
| Access Tier           | Access status required to hold, claim, or govern coin (user, master, division head, etc.)  | Enum/String        | "High", "Ritual Leader"                 |
| Scroll-Seal           | Unique registry symbol or on-chain NFT hash signifying authenticity/ritual legitimacy      | String/Bytes/NFT   | "CouncilSigil" or NFT tokenID           |
| Reinvestment Logic    | Description/contract pointer for recursive growth (e.g., returns into node, vault, or grants)| String/Bytes       | "Auto-compound", contract ref           |
| Scholarship Reference | Narrative or documentation source (codex or lore reference)                                | String/Text/URI    | "Lost Islands of Duviri; Archive 9"     |
| Audit Trail           | Hash or contract pointer to all on-chain actions for compliance, audit, or reward history  | Bytes/URI/List     | Audit log hash; contract log pointer    |

Below, each field is detailed with both the **purpose** and an implementation texture, suitable for mapping in Solidity or Rust for WASM deployments.

---

#### **Coin Name**
Names the BleuCoin or node-issued token, serving as a cross-chain identifier and registry reference. Immutable at registration.

#### **Vault Route**
Defines the routing logic for the vault infrastructure:
- "Council Vault" → Delegated multi-signature with event-driven yield.
- "Larder Vault" → Ritual kitchen, time-locked, consumable NFT recipe withdrawals.
- For EVM: save as "bytes32" in Solidity or string in Rust.

#### **Yield Cycle**
Specifies how and when coin yields/rewards are generated:
- Enum values: "Continuous", "Event", "Seasonal", "Single-use".
- EVM: Encoded as uint8 or string; pattern-matched in contract.

#### **Access Tier**
Level of access required for key functions (holding, covernance, claiming):
- Enum: "User", "Premium", "Ceremony-leader", "Division-head", "Quest-completed", etc.
- Access rules enforced in contract modifier or via NFT-gated mechanism.

#### **Scroll-Seal**
Unique identifier (e.g., NFT, signature, or hash) that certifies the coin, action, or registry is authentic and tied to ritual legitimacy or ceremonial confirmation.
- Blockchain practical: ERC-721 tokenID or hex digest.

#### **Reinvestment Logic**
Logic or contract controlling auto-compounding, charity, or scholarship reallocation of part of the yield; can be a set of rules in smart contract or a dynamic circuit:
- Example: "Auto-compound 20% back to park fund", or external contract pointer (address or hash).
- Often implemented as a function or policy in ERC-4626-compatible vault.

#### **Scholarship Reference**
Narrative, codex, or lore reference for ceremonial legitimacy, educational context, or governance rationale:
- Could be a URI, pointer to digital scriptorium, or reference to a recognized lore NFT.

#### **Audit Trail**
On-chain and/or off-chain reference containing the complete, immutable log of actions for this token; ensures compliance, trust, and enables third-party verification.
- May point to logs (e.g., chain events), hashes (e.g., IPFS), or an on-chain contract storing event logs (see below for Solidity pattern).

---

**Example Solidity Registry Schema (Minimal, EVM-friendly):**

```solidity
struct BleuCoinRegistryEntry {
    string coinName;
    string vaultRoute;
    string yieldCycle;
    string accessTier;
    string scrollSeal; // e.g., NFT tokenID or IPFS hash
    string reinvestmentLogic; // e.g., ref to contract or function descriptor
    string scholarshipReference;
    bytes32 auditTrail; // hash of log or on-chain address
}
```
*Add array or mapping of these structs for dynamic access; see https://research.csiro.au/blockchainpatterns/general-patterns/contract-structural-patterns/contract-registry/ for upgradability contract registry design.*

---

### **B. Vault Route Logic**

Vault patterns emphasize security, upgradability, and ritual transparency:

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Deposit/withdraw state changes precede any external calls, minimizing reentrancy risks.
- **Pull-over-Push Payment**: No automatic token transfer to external addresses; instead, "withdrawClaim" functions credit claimable balances (with recipient-initiated withdrawal under nonReentrant guard).
- **Upgradeable Proxy Storage Gaps**: Contracts must leave storage gaps for upgrades.
- **Oracle and Time-Locked Guards**: Price feeds and governance votes are checked for staleness and can be paused during abnormal events.

**Example Vault Withdrawal Logic (Solidity):**

```solidity
function withdrawClaim(uint256 shares) public nonReentrant {
    require(shares > 0, "Nothing to claim");
    uint256 amount = computeClaimable(shares, msg.sender);
    // Internal accounting: burn shares or update mapping
    ...
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

All actions, claims, and payouts are hash-logged for compliance.

---

### **C. On-Chain Governance Circuit Patterns**

BLEUE governance uses advanced DAO models:

- **Delegate-based voting** and **multi-house structures**: Delegates, councils, or circles approve proposals with thresholds not reliant solely on token holding (to resist plutocracy).
- **Time-aware permissioning**: Proposals, edits, and votes must occur within specified governance epochs, with edits resetting approvals.
- **Emergency Circuits**: Pausable controls, rate limits, and multi-sig approval for protocol halts/resumes.
- **Role Assignment and Revocation Logs**: All role grants and removals are event-hashed in the audit trail for compliance auditing and ritual record-keeping.

---

### **D. Audit Trail Patterns and Compliance**

**Audit Trail Objective**: Map and ensure full decision chain provenance, as demanded by both auditors and ritual scholars.

- **Immutable Ledger**: All actions timestamped and logged on-chain using event emission and, for large artifacts, additional IPFS-stored logs with hash links on chain.
- **Layered Documentation**: Technical events, operational procedures, and cryptographic proofs of actions all linked.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adaptable to US SEC/FinCEN and other global compliance standards via extensible log types (e.g., operational events, authority proofs, technical verifications).

**Sample Solidity Audit Event Chain:**

```solidity
event AuditEvent(bytes32 indexed eventHash, string eventType, string actor, uint256 timestamp);

struct AuditLogEntry {
    bytes32 eventHash;
    string eventType;
    string actor;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bytes32 docHash; // e.g. IPFS hash
}
```

---

## **IV. Visual, Ceremonial, and Schema Layouts**

### **A. Visual Ceremonial Scroll and Node Map Description**

- **Scroll Headers**: Each node type is introduced with a H3 header, symbolizing division of the infrastructure.
- **Tables**: Used judiciously to summarize relationships, coin fields, and vault patterns.
- **Spirals, Radials, Fractals**: Visualize the BLEUE network as a combination of a central spiral (mood/emotion cycle), radiating concentric circles (division, city, bank), and fractal branchings (144 divisions, Codex branches), reflecting the multi-layered governance and functional diversity.
- **Iconography**: Each scroll-seal is a symbolic reference, e.g., tree, council glyph, constellation, feather, etc.—easily rendered as NFT metadata for on-chain representation.

### **B. Markdown Table Implementation Principles**

- **Alignment**: Node/circuit categories left-aligned; numerical or value fields right-aligned.
- **Multi-line Cells**: Use line breaks within cells for readability of complex rules.
- **Semantic Structure**: Node summary first, detailed field schemas immediately after, followed by Vault, Governance, and Audit patterns—creating a logical flow for both technical validation and ceremonial context.

---

## **V. Ritual Reinvestment and Scholarship Reference Patterns**

### **A. Reinvestment Logic**

- **Buff Stacking**: Ritual grants, decree stacking, or power-ups through recurring contribution (as in DeFi auto-compounders or makerDAOs’ continuous loan pools).
- **Scholarship Recirculation**: A fixed or dynamic share of vault yield is re-injected into node scholarships, e.g., funding Codex compilers, festival curation, or healing initiatives.
- **Progressive Unlocks**: As node participants reach higher ceremonial standing or narrative milestones, new reinvestment routes open automatically via smart contract-controlled “Scroll-Seal” access.

### **B. Scholarship Reference**

- **Codex Pointers**: All coins and actions reference a legal or narrative anchor point in the Living Lexicon—enabling literary or educational audits along with security reviews.
- **NFT Scrolls**: Digital codices, poems, or prophecies as NFTs anchor both the spiritual and procedural worlds.

---

## **VI. Ceremonial Closure and Readiness for Deployment**

In closing, the **BLEUE Infrastructure Map Scroll and Registry Schema** presented here is not merely a technocratic registry for smart-contract deployment. It is a living, breathing document: as much ceremonial artifact as technical manual, investing every node, circuit, coin, and lineage with story, symbol, and system. On-chain, each field, node, and pattern is not just a syntax or storage variable but a ritual, a repeated promise, and the foundation for an evolving society that bridges digital, ecological, and mythic realities.

*May the contract you now deploy be as resilient as the old world’s forests, as luminous as the archives of the Compilers, as just as the Spiral Council, and as true as the endless ledgers of the Blue Banks.*
